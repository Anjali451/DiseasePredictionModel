**Predictive Health Care Analytics**
-------------------
To evaluate healthcare data and produce insightful information that can help both individuals and medical professionals, this project incorporates machine learning algorithms.
By using historical patient records, symptom patterns, and medical test results, our system can provide early disease predictions and risk assessments.
The goal of this project is not to replace doctors but to assist in early diagnosis and intervention, reducing healthcare burdens and improving patient outcomes.

**Features**
-------------------
In our project we have used 3 different models for different purpose.
First, I worked on predicting general disease based on user symptoms using Random Forest Classifier.
Next, focused on heart disease. To create a model that predict the person have any heart disease or not we have used Logistic Regression algorithm.
Lastly, used Random Forest again for creating a model that predict the person is diabetic, non- diabetic or pre- diabetic

**Technologies Used**
-------------------
Python Libraries:

  Numpy
  Pandas
  Tensoflow
  Scikit-Learn
  Seaborn
  Matplotlib
  Streamlit

**Usage**
-------------------
This project is particularly beneficial for:
• Patients: Those who are experiencing symptoms and want to assess their potential health risks before seeking medical consultation.
• Medical Practitioners: Doctors and healthcare professionals can use this system as a decision support tool to help early diagnosis and risk assessment.
• Healthcare Institutions: Hospitals and clinics can integrate this system into their diagnostic workflow, allowing for faster screenings and better allocation of medical resources.
